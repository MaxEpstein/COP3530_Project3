ideas for possible outputs:
    - average delay time
    - average delay time by major airline
    - average delay time by major airport
    - highest average delay time for three above
    - highest ever delay
    - shortest ever delay (earliest arrival)
    - what day of the week had most delays?
    - what day of the week had least delays?
    - what time of day had most delays (morning, afternoon, night)
    - above, least delays
    - when the distance of the flight increases, do the amount of delays also increase?
    - how many flights were cancelled in 2008?
    - total number of delays in 2008?
    - what contributed to most delays? (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft)
