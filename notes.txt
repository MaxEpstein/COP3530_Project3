ideas for possible outputs:
    - average delay time
    - average delay time by major airline
    - average delay time by major airport
    - highest average delay time for three above
    - highest ever delay
    - shortest ever delay (earliest arrival)
    - what day of the week had most delays?
    - what day of the week had least delays?
    - what time of day had most delays (morning, afternoon, night)
    - above, least delays
    - when the distance of the flight increases, do the amount of delays also increase?
    - how many flights were cancelled in 2008?
    - total number of delays in 2008?
    - what contributed to most delays? (carrier, weather, NAS, security, late aircraft)

- for flights with NA for flight delay and flights that never took off, they are ommited from all calculations as the flight never occured
- csv file was cut down to 200,000 indexes from 2,400,000 for sake of runtime
- includes all commerical domestic flights from january 1st, 2008 to jan 20th, 2008
- over 200,000

see time it takes to search in our 2008 dataset
    ie. print all delayed flights from X airline, search for all flights by X airline, search for all flights out of X airport, etc


graph:
Flight number
Origin
Destination


Average Delay Time of an Airport
Average Delay time between two airports

Hashmap:
Key = Flight Number + Date
data structure for tuple: <Flight
